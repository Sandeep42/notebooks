The human genome has around ~1500 DNA binding proteins and ~1400 RNA binding proteins. These proteins bind to particular strand of DNA or RNA that will indirectly control so many properties of cell. A particular protein might mask at a particular position which could allow the cell to divide frequently. This interaction could be understood very well using large scale experiments. A failure in protein binding would cause an odd behavior of cell, which can be the basis for a chronic disease.

This data is from dreamchallenges.org, it contains the protein- DNA interactions for 20 proteins in rats.
